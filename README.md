# U.S. Prosecutor Database
> **DEMO:** [https://light-pollution.herokuapp.com/](https://light-pollution.herokuapp.com/)

The **U.S. Prosecutor Database** (formerly *light-pollution*), is a collection of elected and appointed State attorneys in the United States. It showcases prosecutor history at the local, state, and federal level:
* Attorney Generals
* U.S. Attorneys
* District Attorneys
* Municipal/City Attorneys

## **STATUS:** User Discovery

We are currently in the **User Discovery** phase. You can help us by filling out our User Discovery form:

## **JOIN US:** Remote Datathon Sessions

Every Sunday, I host remote Datathon sessions. We meet via Skype to:
* Discuss recent prosecutor news, primary results, and campaigns
* Brainstorm ways to hold prosecutors accountable
* Manually search Google by hand for prosecutor data

**You don't have to be a developer or a prisoners' rights activist to join.** We're looking for all types of people with all types of expertise to collaborate with.

With that being said, we'd love any developers to join us if you've got a solution for automating and/or scripting our labor intensive search process.

If you'd like to volunteer and help with the US Prosecutor Database, or if you're curious about attending a Datathon session, send me an email (see: [GitHub profile](https://www.github.com/billimarie)) and [RSVP on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/211788386222953/).
