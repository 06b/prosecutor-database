# U.S. Prosecutor Database
## 2018 Updates Can Be Found On Our Live Twitter Sessions: [@USProsecutorDB](https://twitter.com/USProsecutorDB)

The **U.S. Prosecutor Database** (formerly *light-pollution*), is a collection of elected and appointed State attorneys in the United States. It showcases prosecutor history at the local, state, and federal level:
* Attorney Generals
* U.S. Attorneys
* District Attorneys
* Municipal/City Attorneys

## **JOIN US:** Remote Datathon Sessions

Every Sunday, we meet via Skype to:
* Discuss recent prosecutor news, primary results, and campaigns
* Brainstorm ways to hold prosecutors accountable
* Manually search Google by hand for prosecutor data

**You don't have to be a developer or a prisoners' rights activist to join.** We're looking for all types of people with all types of expertise to collaborate with.

We'd love any developers to join us if you've got a solution for automating and/or scripting our labor intensive search process.

If you'd like to volunteer and help with the US Prosecutor Database, or if you're curious about attending a Datathon session, send an email (see: [GitHub profile](https://www.github.com/billimarie)) and follow [@USProsecutorDB on Twitter](https://twitter.com/USProsecutorDB).
