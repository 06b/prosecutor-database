# U.S. Prosecutor Database

The **U.S. Prosecutor Database** (formerly *light-pollution*), is a collection of elected and appointed State attorneys in the United States (Attorney Generals, U.S. Attorneys, District Attorneys, Municipal/City Attorneys). It showcases prosecutor history at the local, state, and federal level.

## STATUS: User Discovery
