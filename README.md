Thanks for volunteering to build the U.S. Prosecutor Database.

View the web app: [U.S. Prosecutor Database](https://us-prosecutor-database.herokuapp.com/)

**Our top priority is gathering data for DISTRICT & STATE ATTORNEYS, only.** [Instructions](#instructions) are below.

You can read about [why](https://github.com/billimarie/prosecutor-database/blob/master/DOCS.md#0-history-why-prosecutors) we've chosen to [highlight prosecutor data](https://github.com/billimarie/prosecutor-database/blob/master/DOCS.md#0-history-why-prosecutors) as well as a [brief summary](https://github.com/billimarie/prosecutor-database/blob/master/DOCS.md#1-overview) of the web app on the repo's [**DOCS.md**](https://github.com/billimarie/prosecutor-database/blob/master/DOCS.md).

## Instructions

1.) Search our [live web app](https://us-prosecutor-database.herokuapp.com/) for counties & states which do *not* have District or State Attorney information.

2.) After choosing a state & county (or counties) to focus on, create a *private* copy of our [U.S. Prosecutor Google Sheet]().

3.) Manually search for the prosecutor information available online, then populate the sheet with the data you can find.

3.) Once you've finished, [reply to this issue](https://github.com/billimarie/prosecutor-database/issues/80).

4.) Your data will be added to the database, & your GitHub profile will be added to the contributors gallery.

## Post-Carceral

**Post-Carceral** is a digital community group of volunteers working on civic tech projects (like the US Prosecutor Database) in service of working toward a post-carceral ("beyond prison") world.

### Stay Updated

- [Sign up for our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/dqPQdL).
- You can also find USPD updates on our Twitter: [@USProsecutorDB](https://twitter.com/USProsecutorDB).
- To get involved in a remote Sunday session, follow [@postcarceral](https://twitter.com/postcarceral). This is our general prisoners' rights group responsible for housing the USPD project.

### Volunteer

You don't have to be a developer or a prisoners' rights activist to join. We're looking for all types of people with all types of interests & expertise to collaborate with.

**Datathons**: On Sundays, we hang out remotely and discuss recent prosecutor news, primary results, & campaigns. We also brainstorm new ways to collect data (considering the strange logic of the prosecutorial system, especially as it differs between localities & regions). If you'd like to join, send me an email.
